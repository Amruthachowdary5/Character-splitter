The present appeal is directed against the Final Judgment dated \\n28.04.2009 (hereinafter referred to as the “Impugned Judgment”) \\npassed by the Madurai Bench, Madras High Court (hereinafter \\nreferred to as “the High Court”) dismissing a Second Appeal [S.A. \\n(MD) No.1127 of 2008] filed by the appellants/original defendants.\\nBRIEF FACTS:\\n3. The appellants no.1, 2 and 3 entered into a registered Agreement of \\nSale (hereinafter referred to as the “Agreement”) with the respondents \\non 22.11.1990 to sell the suit property for a consideration of \\nRs.21,000/-, against which Rs.3000/- had been received in advance. \\nFurther, six months’ time was fixed for completion of the transaction. \\nThe appellants No.1, 2 & 3, in the meantime, had executed a Sale \\nDeed with regard to the property in question with appellant no.7 on \\n05.11.1997 for a consideration of Rs.22,000/-. On 18.11.1997, the', metadata={'source': 'AIJA.pdf', 'page': 2}), Document(page_content='[2024] 1 S.C.R.  377\\nAlagammal and Ors. v. Ganesan and Anr.\\nrespondents sent a Notice to the appellants calling upon them to \\nexecute the Agreement. This led to the respondents filing of Original \\nSuit No.165 of 1998 before the Munsif, District Court, Dindigul \\nagainst the appellants for specific performance of the Agreement, \\ndamages and for recovery of money with interest. The suit stood \\ndismissed by the Principal District Munsif Judge , Dindigul by order \\ndated 10.09.2000. An appeal bearing A.S. No.258 of 2008 filed by \\nthe respondents was allowed by the First Appellate Court, and the \\nsame has been upheld by the High Court by the Impugned Judgment \\ndated 28.04.2009.\\nSUBMISSIONS BY THE APPELLANTS:\\n4. Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that as per the \\nAgreement, the balance consideration amount of Rs. 18,000/- was \\nto be paid within six months which was admittedly not done. He \\nsubmitted that the so-called subsequent payments on 16.12.1990 \\nof Rs.1,000/-; on 15.04.1991 of Rs.3,000/-, and; on 17.09.1991 of \\nRs.2,500/- though were not actually paid to the appellants and even \\nwithout admitting the same and accepting it for the sake of argument, \\nthe same is incorrect as the fingerprint expert has found the thumb-\\nimpression of the appellant no.1 as not matching the admitted actual \\nsample thumb-impression of the appellant no.1. and, thus, the very \\nbasis of holding that time was not the essence of the agreement \\ngets washed away. It was submitted that the Agreement stipulated \\nthat if there was default on the part of the respondents, the advance \\npaid would be forfeited, and the entitlement to obtain the Sale Deed \\nand get possession free from all encumbrances would also end. \\n5. It was submitted that once the fingerprint has been disapproved of by \\nan expert and such report has been brought before the First Appellate \\nCourt, the claim based on such a document on which forgery has \\nbeen committed itself renders the whole transaction inadmissible in \\nlaw on the well-settled principle that the respondents did not come \\nbefore the Court with clean hands as the entire claim was based \\non a forged document.\\n6. It was submitted that the claim of the respondents to have paid \\nRs.3,000/- on 18.09.1992; Rs.1,800/- on 24.07.1996; Rs.1,300/- on \\n25.07.1996 and Rs.1,000/- on 29.07.1996 i.e., a total of Rs.20,425/-', metadata={'source': 'AIJA.pdf', 'page': 3}), Document(page_content='378 [2024] 1 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nand ultimately Rs.1,000/- on 21.04.1997 i.e., an excess of Rs. 425/- \\nover the amount indicated in the Agreement, was false.\\n7. Learned counsel submitted that the endorsement(s) made not having \\nbeen proved, it cannot be assumed that the respondents were ready \\nand willing, or that they had, in fact, paid the excess amount.\\n8. It was contended that the Legal Notice sent on behalf of the \\nrespondents dated 18.11.1997 was clearly to get over the fatal \\nlapses on their part and to give life to a dead cause i.e., revive the \\nAgreement, which already stood incapable of being executed through \\nCourt due to efflux of time. On this issue, the contention was that \\nreadiness and willingness must be pleaded and proved which has not \\nbeen done as is clear from the averments made in the plaint filed by \\nthe respondents. Thus, it was submitted that the trial court and even \\nthe First Appellate Court not recording any finding on the aspect of \\nthe readiness and willingness on the part of the respondents, the \\nHigh Court’s observation in the Impugned Judgement on readiness \\nand willingness of the respondents is without basis.\\n9. Learned counsel submitted that readiness and willingness has to be \\nspecifically pleaded and proved as per Section 16(c) of the Specific \\nRelief Act, 1963 (hereinafter referred to as the “1963 Act”) and there \\ncannot be any question of drawing inference. Thus, he submitted that \\nthe respondents were obliged to obtain stamp-paper and draw up the \\nSale Deed, of which there is no indication in the plaint. It was urged \\nthat this establishes that there was no readiness and willingness to \\ncomply with their obligations in terms of the Agreement.\\n10. Learned counsel submitted that the thumb-impression(s) in the \\nendorsement(s) have neither matched nor been found to be identical \\nas per the fingerprint expert’s report which has been referred to in \\nthe judgment of the First Appellate Court.\\n11. Learned counsel submitted that as per the judgment rendered by \\nthe First Appellate Court and affirmed by the High Court, the last \\npayment made and endorsed on 17.09.1991 has been accepted and \\nthus three years from such date would be 16.09.1994 but the suit was \\ninstituted only on 23.03.1998, which is clearly barred by limitation.\\n12. It was submitted that the Trial Court had found that the endorsements \\nwere silent regarding extension of time, which finding has not been \\ndisturbed either by the First Appellate Court or the High Court and', metadata={'source': 'AIJA.pdf', 'page': 4}), Document(page_content='[2024] 1 S.C.R.  379\\nAlagammal and Ors. v. Ganesan and Anr.\\nlooking at the issue from such angle, six months’ time under the \\nAgreement would expire on 21.05.1991 and a three-year limitation \\nwould end on 22.05.1994. On this, learned counsel submitted that \\nthe contention of the respondents that the limitation would start \\nfrom the judgment rendered in Original Suit No.551 of 1992 dated \\n24.07.1996, filed by appellant no.1 for seeking possession and eviction \\nof her husband and mother-in-law from the suit property, is not the \\ncorrect legal perspective, as mere absence of possession would not \\nhave defeated the passing of title from the appellants in favour of \\nthe respondents by the execution of a Sale Deed. The object of the \\nAgreement was only for conveying the title of the property in question.\\n13. Learned counsel submitted that neither Original Suit No.551 of 1992 \\nnor the judgment rendered therein have been mentioned by the \\nrespondents in Original Suit No.165 of 1998 for computing the cause \\nof action for filing suit in the year 1998 with regard to the Agreement, \\nwhich was entered into in 1990. Further, it was urged that it was \\nincumbent upon the respondents to have obtained the Sale Deed \\nand possession through Court as set forth in the Default Clause in \\nthe Agreement and thus, the Legal Notice dated 18.11.1997 by the \\nrespondents would not extend the time as it had expired much before \\nand such unilateral issuance of notice would not get over the legal \\nbar of Article 54 of the Limitation Act, 1963 (hereinafter referred to \\nas the “Act”).\\n14. Learned counsel summed up arguments by contending that in any \\nview of the matter, prior to filing of the suit, the property in question had \\nalready been sold under registered Sale Deed to the appellant no.7 \\nand the suit for specific performance was required to be dismissed \\nas the Sale Deed to appellant no.7 has not been challenged.\\n15. Learned counsel relied upon the decision of this Court in K.S. \\nVidyanadam v Vairavan, (1997) 3 SCC 1, at Paragraphs 10, 11 \\nand 13 for the proposition that Courts in India have consistently held \\nthat in the case of agreement of sale relating to immovable property, \\ntime is not the essence of the contract unless specifically provided \\nto that effect, and the period of limitation prescribed by the Act for \\nfiling a suit was 3 years.\\n16. It was contended that in the aforesaid judgment, the terms of the \\nagreement therein were identical to the instant Agreement, inasmuch \\nas there was no reference to any tenant in the building and it was', metadata={'source': 'AIJA.pdf', 'page': 5}), Document(page_content='380 [2024] 1 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nstated that within six months, the plaintiff should purchase the \\nstamp-papers and pay the balance consideration upon which the \\ndefendants shall execute the Sale Deed either in his name or the \\nname(s) proposed by him before the Sub-Registrar. It was restated \\nthat there was no prior letter/notice from the plaintiffs (respondents) \\nto the defendants (appellants) calling upon them to get the Sale Deed \\nexecuted till the issuance of the Legal Notice dated 18.11.1997 i.e., \\nafter a gap of 6 ½ years, identical to the facts in K.S. Vidyanadam \\n(supra).\\nSUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS:\\n17. In opposition to the appeal, learned counsel for the respondents \\nsubmitted that on 23.03.1992, appellant no.1 had filed Original Suit \\nNo.551 of 1992 against her husband, mother-in-law, second wife of \\nher husband and the son of the second wife, which was decreed. \\nHe submitted that appellants even after accepting Rs.425/- over \\nand above the amount indicated in the Agreement and even after \\ngetting a decree for declaration and possession of the suit property \\nin her favour on 24.07.1996, did not execute the Sale Deed due \\nto which Legal Notice was sent to her on 18.11.1997. As no action \\nwas taken, the respondents were forced to file a suit on 23.03.1998 \\nseeking specific performance.\\n18. Learned counsel submitted that the First Appellate Court had recorded \\nthat the Sale Deed executed by appellant no.1 in favour of appellant \\nno.7 dated 05.11.1997 was not bonafide as the said sale was effected \\nafter getting an order for declaration and recovery of possession of \\nthe suit property in favour of appellant no.1 on 24.07.1996 in Original \\nSuit No.551 of 1992.\\n19. Learned counsel submitted that the issue whether time is the \\nessence of the contract i.e., the Agreement would depend also on \\nthe conduct of the parties and in the present case, when money \\nwas accepted by appellant no.1, much after the stipulated time, \\nclearly the Agreement’s validity so as to culminate in sale could not \\nbe said to have been extinguished, as by accepting money later, \\nthe time indicated for completion of the transaction by execution of \\nSale Deed had been relaxed.\\n20. It was contended that the actual intention of the parties was not \\nonly to execute the Sale Deed but also handover the possession', metadata={'source': 'AIJA.pdf', 'page': 6}), Document(page_content='[2024] 1 S.C.R.  381\\nAlagammal and Ors. v. Ganesan and Anr.\\nwhich is an implied term of every sale of immovable property and \\nthus only when on 24.07.1996, the appellant concerned became \\ncapable of handing over possession, limitation would start from such \\ndate as otherwise even if the Sale Deed was executed in favour of \\nthe respondents, it would have been of no real consequence in the \\nabsence of possession being capable of hand over.\\n21. Learned counsel contended that the stand taken by the appellants, \\nthat the proposed sale was only for transfer of title and not possession, \\ncannot be accepted since the sale of immovable property is always \\nfor the transfer of possession from the seller to the buyer in terms of \\nSection 5 read with Section 54 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 \\n(hereinafter referred to as the “TP Act”). Further, it was submitted that \\nSection 55(f) of the TP Act contemplates duty of the seller to hand \\nover possession of the property at the time of sale, and if the seller \\nis not in possession of the property at the time of the agreement to \\nsell or thereafter, it is a “material defect” in the property necessarily \\nto be disclosed to the purchaser at the time of sale in accordance \\nwith Section 55(1)(a) of the TP Act. Thus, according to him, it is the \\nobligation of the seller to hand over possession at the time of sale, \\nas was stipulated in the Agreement.\\n22. On the question of whether time is of the essence in such a contract, \\nit was contended that when a party is not in possession to hand over \\nthe same at the time of execution of an agreement for sale, then \\ntime would not be of the essence as the right to sue would accrue in \\nfavour of the person to whom the suit property is required to be sold \\nonly upon the vendor being in a position to hand over possession of \\nthe property to the buyer. It was further submitted that subsequent \\nconduct of parties is also relevant for testing whether time is of the \\nessence of the contract in question. It was submitted that in the \\npresent case, the acceptance of money much after the expiry of the \\nsix-month period by the appellant no.1 from the respondents leaves \\nno doubt that time was not the essence and the time for performance \\nof the Agreement would commence only after obtainment of physical \\npossession by the appellants.\\n23. In support of his contentions, learned counsel relied upon the decision \\nof this Court in Godhra Electricity Company Limited v State of', metadata={'source': 'AIJA.pdf', 'page': 7}), Document(page_content='382 [2024] 1 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nGujarat, (1975) 1 SCC 199, the relevant paragraphs being 11 to 16; \\nof the United Kingdom Supreme Court in The Commissioners for \\nHer Majesty’s Revenue and Customs v Secret Hotels2 Limited \\n(formerly Med Hotels Limited), [2014] UKSC 16 dated 05.03.2014, \\nthe relevant being paragraph 331, and; The Interpretation of \\nContracts, 7th Edition by Sir Kim Lewison,  the relevant being \\nparagraph 3.189.\\nANALYSIS, REASONING AND CONCLUSION:\\n24. Having considered the matter, this Court finds that the Judgment \\nimpugned cannot be sustained. The moot question revolves around \\nwhether the Agreement dated 22.11.1990 discloses a fixed time-\\nframe for making payment in full by the respondents that is, in terms \\nof the recitals in the agreement for sale executed by the appellant \\nno.1 in favour of the respondents. The admitted position is that the \\ntime indicated in the Agreement was six months from 22.11.1990 \\ni.e., till 21.05.1991 and as per the Legal Notice dated 18.11.1997 \\nsent by the respondents to the appellants, only Rs.7000/- was paid \\nwithin the time stipulated. Perusal of the Agreement reveals that the \\nrespondents had agreed to pay the appellants Rs.21,000/- for the \\nproperty in question, out of which Rs.3,000/- was already paid as \\nearnest money and the rest was to be paid within 6 months. The \\nrespondents were to purchase stamp papers at their expense and \\nthe appellants had to register the Sale Deed either in the name of \\nthe respondent no.1 or as proposed by him before the Sub-Registrar \\nafter paying the remaining/balance amount. If the appellants failed \\nto register the Sale Deed, respondent no.1 had a right to deposit \\nthe balance of sale consideration in the Civil Court and get sale with \\npossession effected through Court from the first party i.e., appellants \\nno.1 to 3.\\n1 ‘33. In English law it is not permissible to take into account the subsequent behaviour or statements of \\nthe parties as an aid to interpreting their written agreement – see FL Schuler AG v Wickman Machine \\nTool Sales Ltd [1974] AC 235. The subsequent behaviour or statements of the parties can, however, be \\nrelevant, for a number of other reasons. First, they may be invoked to support the contention that the \\nwritten agreement was a sham – ie that it was not in fact intended to govern the parties’ relationship \\nat all. Secondly, they may be invoked in support of a claim for rectification of the written agreement. \\nThirdly, they may be relied on to support a claim that the written agreement was subsequently varied, \\nor rescinded and replaced by a subsequent contract (agreed by words or conduct). Fourthly, they may \\nbe relied on to establish that the written agreement represented only part of the totality of the parties’ \\ncontractual relationship. ’', metadata={'source': 'AIJA.pdf', 'page': 8}), Document(page_content='[2024] 1 S.C.R.  383\\nAlagammal and Ors. v. Ganesan and Anr.\\n25. At this juncture, the Court would indicate that within six months there \\nexisted the onus of paying the entire balance amount of Rs.18,000/- \\nby the respondent no.1 to the appellant no.1. It is not the case of the \\nrespondents that they had even offered to pay the remaining/balance \\namount before the expiry of the six-month period. Thus, payment \\nof Rs.3,000/- only out of Rs.21,000/- having been made, or at best \\nRs.7,000/- out of Rs.21,000/-, which is the amount indicated in the \\nLegal Notice sent by the respondents to the appellants, the obvious \\nimport would be that the respondents had not complied with their \\nobligation under the Agreement within the six-month period.\\n26. Pausing here, it is notable that the appellant no.1 having accepted \\npayment of Rs.1,000/- on 21.04.1997 i.e., after appellant no.1 had \\nexecuted a Sale Deed in favour of appellant no.7 on 05.11.1997, \\ncoupled with the fact that the forensic expert found the two thumb-\\nimpressions purportedly acknowledging payment after the expiry \\nof the time fixed not matching the fingerprints of appellant no.1 is \\nclearly indicative that time having not been extended, no enforceable \\nright accrued to the respondents for getting relief under the 1963 \\nAct. At the highest, if the appellant no.1 had accepted money from \\nrespondent no.1 after the expiry of the time-limit, which itself has not \\nbeen conclusively proved during trial or even at the first or second \\nappellate stages, the remedy available to the defendants was to seek \\nrecovery of such money(ies) paid along with damages or interest to \\ncompensate such loss but a suit for specific performance to execute \\nthe Sale Deed would not be available, in the prevalent facts and \\ncircumstances. In the present case, there is also no explanation, \\nas to why, an excess amount of Rs.425/-, as claimed, was paid \\nby respondent no.1 to the appellant no.1, when the respondents’ \\nspecific stand is that due to the appellants not being in possession \\nof the property so as to hand over possession to the respondents, \\ndelay was occasioned. The submission that no adverse effect \\ncould be saddled on the respondents as decree for declaration and \\nrecovery of possession was obtained by appellant no.1 in her favour \\nonly on 27.04.1996 is not acceptable for the reason that there is \\nno averment that pursuant to such decree, she had also obtained \\npossession through execution. Thus, the decree dated 27.04.1996 \\nalso remained only a decree on paper without actual possession \\nto appellant no.1. The contention of the respondents becomes', metadata={'source': 'AIJA.pdf', 'page': 9}), Document(page_content='384 [2024] 1 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nself-contradictory especially with regard to cause of action having \\narisen after such decree in favour of the appellant no.1 since even \\nat the time of filing the underlying suit, actual possession not being \\nwith appellant no.1, the Sale Deed could not have been executed.\\n27. Another important aspect that the Court is expected to consider is \\nthe fact that the appellant no.7 in whose favour there was a Sale \\nDeed with regard to the suit premises, much prior to issuance of \\nany Legal Notice and the institution of the suit in question and that \\nno relief had been sought for cancellation of such Sale Deed, a suit \\nfor specific performance for execution of sale deed qua the very \\nsame property could not be maintained. The matter becomes worse \\nfor the respondents since such relief was also not sought even at \\nthe First Appeal stage nor at the Second Appeal stage, despite the \\nlaw permitting and providing for such course of action. Even the \\nLegal Notice dated 18.11.1997 has been issued after almost seven \\nmonths from the alleged last payment of Rs.1.000/-, as claimed by \\nthe respondents to have been made on 21.04.1997.\\n28. Pertinently, though appellant no.7 was arrayed as a defendant in the \\nsuit, yet no relief seeking cancellation of his Sale Deed was sought for.\\n29. The ratio laid down in K.S. Vidyanadam (supra) which had a similar \\nfactual matrix squarely applies in the facts and circumstances of the \\npresent case, on the issue that time was the essence of contract and \\neven if time is not the essence of the agreement, in the event that \\nthere is no reference of any existence of any tenant in the building \\nand it is mentioned that within a period of six months, the plaintiffs \\nshould purchase the stamp paper and pay the balance consideration \\nwhereupon the defendants will execute the Sale Deed, there is not \\na single letter or notice from the plaintiffs to the defendants calling \\nupon them to the tenant to vacate and get the Sale Deed executed \\nwithin time. Further, the Legal Notice was issued after two and a half \\nyears from expiry of the time period in K.S. Vidyanadam (supra), \\nwhereas in the present case, the Legal Notice has been issued after \\nmore than six and a half years. The relevant paragraphs from K.S. \\nVidyanadam (supra) read as under:\\n‘10.It has been consistently held by the courts in India, \\nfollowing certain early English decisions, that in the case \\nof agreement of sale relating to immovable property, time \\nis not of the essence of the contract unless specifically', metadata={'source': 'AIJA.pdf', 'page': 10}), Document(page_content='[2024] 1 S.C.R.  385\\nAlagammal and Ors. v. Ganesan and Anr.\\nprovided to that effect. The period of limitation prescribed \\nby the Limitation Act for filing a suit is three years. From \\nthese two circumstances, it does not follow that any and \\nevery suit for specific performance of the agreement (which \\ndoes not provide specifically that time is of the essence of \\nthe contract) should be decreed provided it is filed within \\nthe period of limitation notwithstanding the time-limits \\nstipulated in the agreement for doing one or the other thing \\nby one or the other party. That would amount to saying that \\nthe time-limits prescribed by the parties in the agreement \\nhave no significance or value and that they mean nothing. \\nWould it be reasonable to say that because time is not \\nmade the essence of the contract, the time-limit(s) specified \\nin the agreement have no relevance and can be ignored \\nwith impunity?  It would also mean denying the discretion \\nvested in the court by both Sections 10 and 20. As held \\nby a Constitution Bench of this Court in Chand Rani v. \\nKamal Rani [(1993) 1 SCC 519]: (SCC p. 528, para 25)\\n“… it is clear that in the case of sale of immovable \\nproperty there is no presumption as to time being \\nthe essence of the contract. Even if it is not of the \\nessence of the contract, the Court may infer that it is \\nto be performed in a reasonable time if the conditions \\nare (evident?): (1) from the express terms of the \\ncontract; (2) from the nature of the property; and (3) \\nfrom the surrounding circumstances, for example, \\nthe object of making the contract.”\\nIn other words, the court should look at all the relevant \\ncircumstances including the time-limit(s) specified in the \\nagreement and determine whether its discretion to grant \\nspecific performance should be exercised. Now in the \\ncase of urban properties in India, it is well-known that \\ntheir prices have been going up sharply over the last few \\ndecades — particularly after 1973 [ It is a well-known fact \\nthat the steep rise in the price of oil following the 1973 \\nArab-Israeli war set in inflationary trends all over the world. \\nParticularly affected were countries like who import bulk \\nof their requirement of oil.]. In this case, the suit property \\nis the house property situated in Madurai, which is one of', metadata={'source': 'AIJA.pdf', 'page': 11}), Document(page_content='386 [2024] 1 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nthe major cities of Tamil Nadu. The suit agreement was \\nin December 1978 and the six months’ period specified \\ntherein for completing the sale expired with 15-6-1979. The \\nsuit notice was issued by the plaintiff only on 11-7-1981, \\ni.e., more than two years after the expiry of six months’ \\nperiod. The question is what was the plaintiff doing in this \\ninterval of more than two years? The plaintiff says that he \\nhas been calling upon Defendants 1 to 3 to get the tenant \\nvacated and execute the sale deed and that the defendants \\nwere postponing the same representing that the tenant \\nis not vacating the building. The defendants have denied \\nthis story. According to them, the plaintiff never moved \\nin the matter and never called upon them to execute the \\nsale deed. The trial court has accepted the defendants’ \\nstory whereas the High Court has accepted the plaintiff’s \\nstory. Let us first consider whose story is more probable \\nand acceptable. For this purpose, we may first turn to the \\nterms of the agreement. In the agreement of sale, there is \\nno reference to the existence of any tenant in the building. \\nWhat it says is that within the period of six months, the \\nplaintiff should purchase the stamp papers and pay the \\nbalance consideration whereupon the defendants will \\nexecute the sale deed and that prior to the registration \\nof the sale deed, the defendants shall vacate and deliver \\npossession of the suit house to the plaintiff. There is not \\na single letter or notice from the plaintiff to the defendants \\ncalling upon them to get the tenant vacated and get the \\nsale deed executed until he issued the suit notice on 11-7-\\n1981. It is not the plaintiff’s case that within six months’, he \\npurchased the stamp papers and offered to pay the balance \\nconsideration.  The defendants’ case is that the tenant is \\ntheir own relation, that he is ready to vacate at any point \\nof time and that the very fact that the plaintiff has in his \\nsuit notice offered to purchase the house with the tenant \\nitself shows that the story put forward by him is false. The \\ntenant has been examined by the defendant as DW 2. He \\nstated that soon after the agreement, he was searching \\nfor a house but could not secure one. Meanwhile (i.e., \\non the expiry of six months from the date of agreement),', metadata={'source': 'AIJA.pdf', 'page': 12}), Document(page_content='[2024] 1 S.C.R.  387\\nAlagammal and Ors. v. Ganesan and Anr.\\nhe stated, the defendants told him that since the plaintiff \\nhas abandoned the agreement, he need not vacate. It is \\nequally an admitted fact that between 15-12-1978 and 11-\\n7-1981, the plaintiff has purchased two other properties. \\nThe defendants’ consistent refrain has been that the prices \\nof house properties in Madurai have been rising fast, that \\nwithin the said interval of 2 1/2 years, the prices went up \\nthree times and that only because of the said circumstance \\nhas the plaintiff (who had earlier abandoned any idea of \\ngoing forward with the purchase of the suit property) turned \\nround and demanded specific performance. Having regard \\nto the above circumstances and the oral evidence of the \\nparties, we are inclined to accept the case put forward \\nby Defendants 1 to 3. We reject the story put forward by \\nthe plaintiff that during the said period of 2 1/2 years, he \\nhas been repeatedly asking the defendants to get the \\ntenant vacated and execute the sale deed and that they \\nwere asking for time on the ground that tenant was not \\nvacating. The above finding means that from 15-12-1978 \\ntill 11-7-1981, i.e., for a period of more than 2 1/2 years, \\nthe plaintiff was sitting quiet without taking any steps to \\nperform his part of the contract under the agreement \\nthough the agreement specified a period of six months \\nwithin which he was expected to purchase stamp papers, \\ntender the balance amount and call upon the defendants \\nto execute the sale deed and deliver possession of the \\nproperty. We are inclined to accept the defendants’ case \\nthat the values of the house property in Madurai town were \\nrising fast and this must have induced the plaintiff to wake \\nup after 2 1/2 years and demand specific performance.\\n11. Shri Sivasubramaniam cited the decision of the \\nMadras High Court in S.V. Sankaralinga Nadar v. P.T.S. \\nRatnaswami Nadar [AIR 1952 Mad 389 : (1952) 1 MLJ 44] \\nholding that mere rise in prices is no ground for denying \\nthe specific performance. With great respect, we are \\nunable to agree if the said decision is understood as saying \\nthat the said factor is not at all to be taken into account \\nwhile exercising the discretion vested in the court by law. \\nWe cannot be oblivious to the reality — and the reality', metadata={'source': 'AIJA.pdf', 'page': 13}), Document(page_content='388 [2024] 1 S.C.R.\\nDigital Supreme Court Reports\\nis constant and continuous rise in the values of urban \\nproperties — fuelled by large-scale migration of people \\nfrom rural areas to urban centres and by inflation. Take \\nthis very case. The plaintiff had agreed to pay the balance \\nconsideration, purchase the stamp papers and ask for the \\nexecution of sale deed and delivery of possession within \\nsix months. He did nothing of the sort.  The agreement \\nexpressly provides that if the plaintiff fails in performing his \\npart of the contract, the defendants are entitled to forfeit \\nthe earnest money of Rs 5000 and that if the defendants \\nfail to perform their part of the contract, they are liable \\nto pay double the said amount. Except paying the small \\namount of Rs 5000 (as against the total consideration \\nof Rs 60,000) the plaintiff did nothing until he issued the \\nsuit notice 2 1/2 years after the agreement. Indeed, we \\nare inclined to think that the rigor of the rule evolved by \\ncourts that time is not of the essence of the contract in the \\ncase of immovable properties — evolved in times when \\nprices and values were stable and inflation was unknown \\n— requires to be relaxed, if not modified, particularly in \\nthe case of urban immovable properties. It is high time, \\nwe do so. The learned counsel for the plaintiff says that \\nwhen the parties entered into the contract, they knew that \\nprices are rising; hence, he says, rise in prices cannot \\nbe a ground for denying specific performance. May be, \\nthe parties knew of the said circumstance but they have \\nalso specified six months as the period within which the \\ntransaction should be completed. The said time-limit may \\nnot amount to making time the essence of the contract \\nbut it must yet have some meaning. Not for nothing could \\nsuch time-limit would have been prescribed. Can it be \\nstated as a rule of law or rule of prudence that where time \\nis not made the essence of the contract, all stipulations \\nof time provided in the contract have no significance or \\nmeaning or that they are as good as non-existent? All this \\nonly means that while exercising its discretion, the court \\nshould also bear in mind that when the parties prescribe \\ncertain time-limit(s) for taking steps by one or the other \\nparty, it must have some significance and that the said', metadata={'source': 'AIJA.pdf', 'page': 14}), Document(page_content='[2024] 1 S.C.R.  389\\nAlagammal and Ors. v. Ganesan and Anr.\\ntime-limit(s) cannot be ignored altogether on the ground \\nthat time has not been made the essence of the contract \\n(relating to immovable properties).\\nxxx\\n13. In the case before us, it is not mere delay. It is a case \\nof total inaction on the part of the plaintiff for 2 1/2 years \\nin clear violation of the terms of agreement which required \\nhim to pay the balance, purchase the stamp papers and \\nthen ask for execution of sale deed within six months.  \\nFurther, the delay is coupled with substantial rise in prices \\n— according to the defendants, three times — between the \\ndate of agreement and the date of suit notice. The delay \\nhas brought about a situation where it would be inequitable \\nto give the relief of specific performance to the plaintiff.’ \\n(Emphasis supplied)\\n30. The decisions relied upon by the respondents, relating to the conduct \\nof parties are of no avail to them in the circumstances, as even if \\nthe case of later payments by the respondents to the appellants \\nis accepted, the same being at great intervals and there being no \\nwillingness shown by them to pay the remaining amount or getting \\nthe Sale Deed ascribed on necessary stamp paper and giving notice \\nto the appellants to execute the Sale Deed, it cannot be said that \\nin the present case, judged on the anvil of the conduct of parties, \\nespecially the appellants, time would not remain the essence of the \\ncontract.\\n31.

This led to the respondents filing of Original \\nSuit No.165 of 1998 before the Munsif, District Court, Dindigul \\nagainst the appellants for specific performance of the Agreement, \\ndamages and for recovery of money with interest.

Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that as per the \\nAgreement, the balance consideration amount of Rs. 18,000/- was \\nto be paid within six months which was admittedly not done. He \\nsubmitted that the so-called subsequent payments on 16.12.1990 \\nof Rs.1,000/-; on 15.04.1991 of Rs.3,000/-, and; on 17.09.1991 of \\nRs.2,500/- though were not actually paid to the appellants and even \\nwithout admitting the same and accepting it for the sake of argument, \\nthe same is incorrect as the fingerprint expert has found the thumb-\\nimpression of the appellant no.1 as not matching the admitted actual \\nsample thumb-impression of the appellant no.1. and, thus, the very \\nbasis of holding that time was not the essence of the agreement \\ngets washed away. It was submitted that the Agreement stipulated \\nthat if there was default on the part of the respondents, the advance \\npaid would be forfeited, and the entitlement to obtain the Sale Deed \\nand get possession free from all encumbrances would also end. \\n5. It was submitted that once the fingerprint has been disapproved of by \\nan expert and such report has been brought before the First Appellate \\nCourt, the claim based on such a document on which forgery has \\nbeen committed itself renders the whole transaction inadmissible in \\nlaw on the well-settled principle that the respondents did not come \\nbefore the Court with clean hands as the entire claim was based \\non a forged document.\\n6. It was submitted that the claim of the respondents to have paid \\nRs.3,000/- on 18.09.1992; Rs.1,800/- on 24.07.1996; Rs.1,300/- on \\n25.07.1996 and Rs.1,000/- on 29.07.1996 i.e., a total of Rs.20,425/-' metadata={'source': 'AIJA.pdf', 'page': 3}\n",

Learned counsel submitted that the endorsement(s) made not having \\nbeen proved, it cannot be assumed that the respondents were ready \\nand willing, or that they had, in fact, paid the excess amount.\\n8. It was contended that the Legal Notice sent on behalf of the \\nrespondents dated 18.11.1997 was clearly to get over the fatal \\nlapses on their part and to give life to a dead cause i.e., revive the \\nAgreement, which already stood incapable of being executed through \\nCourt due to efflux of time. On this issue, the contention was that \\nreadiness and willingness must be pleaded and proved which has not \\nbeen done as is clear from the averments made in the plaint filed by \\nthe respondents. Thus, it was submitted that the trial court and even \\nthe First Appellate Court not recording any finding on the aspect of \\nthe readiness and willingness on the part of the respondents, the \\nHigh Court’s observation in the Impugned Judgement on readiness \\nand willingness of the respondents is without basis.\\n9. Learned counsel submitted that readiness and willingness has to be \\nspecifically pleaded and proved as per Section 16(c) of the Specific \\nRelief Act, 1963 (hereinafter referred to as the “1963 Act”) and there \\ncannot be any question of drawing inference. Thus, he submitted that \\nthe respondents were obliged to obtain stamp-paper and draw up the \\nSale Deed, of which there is no indication in the plaint.

Further, it was urged that it was \\nincumbent upon the respondents to have obtained the Sale Deed \\nand possession through Court as set forth in the Default Clause in \\nthe Agreement and thus, the Legal Notice dated 18.11.1997 by the \\nrespondents would not extend the time as it had expired much before \\nand such unilateral issuance of notice would not get over the legal \\nbar of Article 54 of the Limitation Act, 1963 (hereinafter referred to \\nas the “Act”).\\n14.

Learned counsel relied upon the decision of this Court in K.S. \\nVidyanadam v Vairavan, (1997) 3 SCC 1, at Paragraphs 10, 11 \\nand 13 for the proposition that Courts in India have consistently held \\nthat in the case of agreement of sale relating to immovable property, \\ntime is not the essence of the contract unless specifically provided \\nto that effect, and the period of limitation prescribed by the Act for \\nfiling a suit was 3 years.\\n16.

In opposition to the appeal, learned counsel for the respondents \\nsubmitted that on 23.03.1992, appellant no.1 had filed Original Suit \\nNo.551 of 1992 against her husband, mother-in-law, second wife of \\nher husband and the son of the second wife, which was decreed. \\nHe submitted that appellants even after accepting Rs.425/- over \\nand above the amount indicated in the Agreement and even after \\ngetting a decree for declaration and possession of the suit property \\nin her favour on 24.07.1996, did not execute the Sale Deed due \\nto which Legal Notice was sent to her on 18.11.1997. As no action \\nwas taken, the respondents were forced to file a suit on 23.03.1998 \\nseeking specific performance.\\n18. Learned counsel submitted that the First Appellate Court had recorded \\nthat the Sale Deed executed by appellant no.1 in favour of appellant \\nno.7 dated 05.11.1997 was not bonafide as the said sale was effected \\nafter getting an order for declaration and recovery of possession of \\nthe suit property in favour of appellant no.1 on 24.07.1996 in Original \\nSuit No.551 of 1992.\\n19. Learned counsel submitted that the issue whether time is the \\nessence of the contract i.e., the Agreement would depend also on \\nthe conduct of the parties and in the present case, when money \\nwas accepted by appellant no.1, much after the stipulated time, \\nclearly the Agreement’s validity so as to culminate in sale could not \\nbe said to have been extinguished, as by accepting money later, \\nthe time indicated for completion of the transaction by execution of \\nSale Deed had been relaxed.\\n20.

Learned counsel contended that the stand taken by the appellants, \\nthat the proposed sale was only for transfer of title and not possession, \\ncannot be accepted since the sale of immovable property is always \\nfor the transfer of possession from the seller to the buyer in terms of \\nSection 5 read with Section 54 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 \\n(hereinafter referred to as the “TP Act”). Further, it was submitted that \\nSection 55(f) of the TP Act contemplates duty of the seller to hand \\nover possession of the property at the time of sale, and if the seller \\nis not in possession of the property at the time of the agreement to \\nsell or thereafter, it is a “material defect” in the property necessarily \\nto be disclosed to the purchaser at the time of sale in accordance \\nwith Section 55(1)(a) of the TP Act. Thus, according to him, it is the \\nobligation of the seller to hand over possession at the time of sale, \\nas was stipulated in the Agreement.\\n22. On the question of whether time is of the essence in such a contract, \\nit was contended that when a party is not in possession to hand over \\nthe same at the time of execution of an agreement for sale, then \\ntime would not be of the essence as the right to sue would accrue in \\nfavour of the person to whom the suit property is required to be sold \\nonly upon the vendor being in a position to hand over possession of \\nthe property to the buyer. It was further submitted that subsequent \\nconduct of parties is also relevant for testing whether time is of the \\nessence of the contract in question. It was submitted that in the \\npresent case, the acceptance of money much after the expiry of the \\nsix-month period by the appellant no.1 from the respondents leaves \\nno doubt that time was not the essence and the time for performance \\nof the Agreement would commence only after obtainment of physical \\npossession by the appellants.\\n23.

Having considered the matter, this Court finds that the Judgment \\nimpugned cannot be sustained. The moot question revolves around \\nwhether the Agreement dated 22.11.1990 discloses a fixed time-\\nframe for making payment in full by the respondents that is, in terms \\nof the recitals in the agreement for sale executed by the appellant \\nno.1 in favour of the respondents. The admitted position is that the \\ntime indicated in the Agreement was six months from 22.11.1990 \\ni.e., till 21.05.1991 and as per the Legal Notice dated 18.11.1997 \\nsent by the respondents to the appellants, only Rs.7000/- was paid \\nwithin the time stipulated. Perusal of the Agreement reveals that the \\nrespondents had agreed to pay the appellants Rs.21,000/- for the \\nproperty in question, out of which Rs.3,000/- was already paid as \\nearnest money and the rest was to be paid within 6 months. The \\nrespondents were to purchase stamp papers at their expense and \\nthe appellants had to register the Sale Deed either in the name of \\nthe respondent no.1 or as proposed by him before the Sub-Registrar \\nafter paying the remaining/balance amount. If the appellants failed \\nto register the Sale Deed, respondent no.1 had a right to deposit \\nthe balance of sale consideration in the Civil Court and get sale with \\npossession effected through Court from the first party i.e., appellants \\nno.1 to 3.\\n1 ‘33. In English law it is not permissible to take into account the subsequent behaviour or statements of \\nthe parties as an aid to interpreting their written agreement – see FL Schuler AG v Wickman Machine \\nTool Sales Ltd [1974] AC 235. The subsequent behaviour or statements of the parties can, however, be \\nrelevant, for a number of other reasons. First, they may be invoked to support the contention that the \\nwritten agreement was a sham – ie that it was not in fact intended to govern the parties’ relationship \\nat all. Secondly, they may be invoked in support of a claim for rectification of the written agreement. \\nThirdly, they may be relied on to support a claim that the written agreement was subsequently varied, \\nor rescinded and replaced by a subsequent contract (agreed by words or conduct). Fourthly, they may \\nbe relied on to establish that the written agreement represented only part of the totality of the parties’ \\ncontractual relationship. ’' metadata={'source': 'AIJA.pdf', 'page': 8}\n",

At this juncture, the Court would indicate that within six months there \\nexisted the onus of paying the entire balance amount of Rs.18,000/- \\nby the respondent no.1 to the appellant no.1. It is not the case of the \\nrespondents that they had even offered to pay the remaining/balance \\namount before the expiry of the six-month period. Thus, payment \\nof Rs.3,000/- only out of Rs.21,000/- having been made, or at best \\nRs.7,000/- out of Rs.21,000/-, which is the amount indicated in the \\nLegal Notice sent by the respondents to the appellants, the obvious \\nimport would be that the respondents had not complied with their \\nobligation under the Agreement within the six-month period.\\n26. Pausing here, it is notable that the appellant no.1 having accepted \\npayment of Rs.1,000/- on 21.04.1997 i.e., after appellant no.1 had \\nexecuted a Sale Deed in favour of appellant no.7 on 05.11.1997, \\ncoupled with the fact that the forensic expert found the two thumb-\\nimpressions purportedly acknowledging payment after the expiry \\nof the time fixed not matching the fingerprints of appellant no.1 is \\nclearly indicative that time having not been extended, no enforceable \\nright accrued to the respondents for getting relief under the 1963 \\nAct. At the highest, if the appellant no.1 had accepted money from \\nrespondent no.1 after the expiry of the time-limit, which itself has not \\nbeen conclusively proved during trial or even at the first or second \\nappellate stages, the remedy available to the defendants was to seek \\nrecovery of such money(ies) paid along with damages or interest to \\ncompensate such loss but a suit for specific performance to execute \\nthe Sale Deed would not be available, in the prevalent facts and \\ncircumstances. In the present case, there is also no explanation, \\nas to why, an excess amount of Rs.425/-, as claimed, was paid \\nby respondent no.1 to the appellant no.1, when the respondents’ \\nspecific stand is that due to the appellants not being in possession \\nof the property so as to hand over possession to the respondents, \\ndelay was occasioned. The submission that no adverse effect \\ncould be saddled on the respondents as decree for declaration and \\nrecovery of possession was obtained by appellant no.1 in her favour \\nonly on 27.04.1996 is not acceptable for the reason that there is \\nno averment that pursuant to such decree, she had also obtained \\npossession through execution. Thus, the decree dated 27.04.1996 \\nalso remained only a decree on paper without actual possession \\nto appellant no.1.

Another important aspect that the Court is expected to consider is \\nthe fact that the appellant no.7 in whose favour there was a Sale \\nDeed with regard to the suit premises, much prior to issuance of \\nany Legal Notice and the institution of the suit in question and that \\nno relief had been sought for cancellation of such Sale Deed, a suit \\nfor specific performance for execution of sale deed qua the very \\nsame property could not be maintained. The matter becomes worse \\nfor the respondents since such relief was also not sought even at \\nthe First Appeal stage nor at the Second Appeal stage, despite the \\nlaw permitting and providing for such course of action. Even the \\nLegal Notice dated 18.11.1997 has been issued after almost seven \\nmonths from the alleged last payment of Rs.1.000/-, as claimed by \\nthe respondents to have been made on 21.04.1997.\\n28. Pertinently, though appellant no.7 was arrayed as a defendant in the \\nsuit, yet no relief seeking cancellation of his Sale Deed was sought for.\\n29. The ratio laid down in K.S. Vidyanadam (supra) which had a similar \\nfactual matrix squarely applies in the facts and circumstances of the \\npresent case, on the issue that time was the essence of contract and \\neven if time is not the essence of the agreement, in the event that \\nthere is no reference of any existence of any tenant in the building \\nand it is mentioned that within a period of six months, the plaintiffs \\nshould purchase the stamp paper and pay the balance consideration \\nwhereupon the defendants will execute the Sale Deed, there is not \\na single letter or notice from the plaintiffs to the defendants calling \\nupon them to the tenant to vacate and get the Sale Deed executed \\nwithin time. Further, the Legal Notice was issued after two and a half \\nyears from expiry of the time period in K.S. Vidyanadam (supra), \\nwhereas in the present case, the Legal Notice has been issued after \\nmore than six and a half years. The relevant paragraphs from K.S. \\nVidyanadam (supra) read as under:\\n‘10.It has been consistently held by the courts in India, \\nfollowing certain early English decisions, that in the case \\nof agreement of sale relating to immovable property, time \\nis not of the essence of the contract unless specifically' metadata={'source': 'AIJA.pdf', 'page': 10}\n",

The period of limitation prescribed \\nby the Limitation Act for filing a suit is three years. From \\nthese two circumstances, it does not follow that any and \\nevery suit for specific performance of the agreement (which \\ndoes not provide specifically that time is of the essence of \\nthe contract) should be decreed provided it is filed within \\nthe period of limitation notwithstanding the time-limits \\nstipulated in the agreement for doing one or the other thing \\nby one or the other party.

It would also mean denying the discretion \\nvested in the court by both Sections 10 and 20.

The suit agreement was \\nin December 1978 and the six months’ period specified \\ntherein for completing the sale expired with 15-6-1979. The \\nsuit notice was issued by the plaintiff only on 11-7-1981, \\ni.e., more than two years after the expiry of six months’ \\nperiod. The question is what was the plaintiff doing in this \\ninterval of more than two years? The plaintiff says that he \\nhas been calling upon Defendants 1 to 3 to get the tenant \\nvacated and execute the sale deed and that the defendants \\nwere postponing the same representing that the tenant \\nis not vacating the building. The defendants have denied \\nthis story. According to them, the plaintiff never moved \\nin the matter and never called upon them to execute the \\nsale deed. The trial court has accepted the defendants’ \\nstory whereas the High Court has accepted the plaintiff’s \\nstory. Let us first consider whose story is more probable \\nand acceptable. For this purpose, we may first turn to the \\nterms of the agreement. In the agreement of sale, there is \\nno reference to the existence of any tenant in the building. \\nWhat it says is that within the period of six months, the \\nplaintiff should purchase the stamp papers and pay the \\nbalance consideration whereupon the defendants will \\nexecute the sale deed and that prior to the registration \\nof the sale deed, the defendants shall vacate and deliver \\npossession of the suit house to the plaintiff. There is not \\na single letter or notice from the plaintiff to the defendants \\ncalling upon them to get the tenant vacated and get the \\nsale deed executed until he issued the suit notice on 11-7-\\n1981. It is not the plaintiff’s case that within six months’, he \\npurchased the stamp papers and offered to pay the balance \\nconsideration.  The defendants’ case is that the tenant is \\ntheir own relation, that he is ready to vacate at any point \\nof time and that the very fact that the plaintiff has in his \\nsuit notice offered to purchase the house with the tenant \\nitself shows that the story put forward by him is false. The \\ntenant has been examined by the defendant as DW 2. He \\nstated that soon after the agreement, he was searching \\nfor a house but could not secure one.

It is \\nequally an admitted fact that between 15-12-1978 and 11-\\n7-1981, the plaintiff has purchased two other properties. \\nThe defendants’ consistent refrain has been that the prices \\nof house properties in Madurai have been rising fast, that \\nwithin the said interval of 2 1/2 years, the prices went up \\nthree times and that only because of the said circumstance \\nhas the plaintiff (who had earlier abandoned any idea of \\ngoing forward with the purchase of the suit property) turned \\nround and demanded specific performance. Having regard \\nto the above circumstances and the oral evidence of the \\nparties, we are inclined to accept the case put forward \\nby Defendants 1 to 3. We reject the story put forward by \\nthe plaintiff that during the said period of 2 1/2 years, he \\nhas been repeatedly asking the defendants to get the \\ntenant vacated and execute the sale deed and that they \\nwere asking for time on the ground that tenant was not \\nvacating. The above finding means that from 15-12-1978 \\ntill 11-7-1981, i.e., for a period of more than 2 1/2 years, \\nthe plaintiff was sitting quiet without taking any steps to \\nperform his part of the contract under the agreement \\nthough the agreement specified a period of six months \\nwithin which he was expected to purchase stamp papers, \\ntender the balance amount and call upon the defendants \\nto execute the sale deed and deliver possession of the \\nproperty.

Take \\nthis very case. The plaintiff had agreed to pay the balance \\nconsideration, purchase the stamp papers and ask for the \\nexecution of sale deed and delivery of possession within \\nsix months. He did nothing of the sort.  The agreement \\nexpressly provides that if the plaintiff fails in performing his \\npart of the contract, the defendants are entitled to forfeit \\nthe earnest money of Rs 5000 and that if the defendants \\nfail to perform their part of the contract, they are liable \\nto pay double the said amount. Except paying the small \\namount of Rs 5000 (as against the total consideration \\nof Rs 60,000) the plaintiff did nothing until he issued the \\nsuit notice 2 1/2 years after the agreement. Indeed, we \\nare inclined to think that the rigor of the rule evolved by \\ncourts that time is not of the essence of the contract in the \\ncase of immovable properties — evolved in times when \\nprices and values were stable and inflation was unknown \\n— requires to be relaxed, if not modified, particularly in \\nthe case of urban immovable properties.
